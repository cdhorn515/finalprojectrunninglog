Proposal:

Build an app for runners so they can keep track of their running activity and share local running routes.
 
 User stories:
  
 As an admin I want to see the demographics of users who are signed up for my site to help determine features to be added.
 
 As a visitor I want to see routes that have been made public by users so I can find places to run locally when visiting the area without having to sign up for an account.
 
 As a visitor I would like to see a map of the area with local parks/running trails highlighted to give me some ideas for where to run.
 
 As a user I want to have my password stored securely on the database so that others can't log into my account.
 
 As a user I can create entries for each run I do so that I can keep track of my mileage and overall progress.
 
 As a user I want the ability to make updates to the information I upload so that I can make any corrections to the data.
 
 As a user I can mark routes as public so visitors to the website can find good places to run.
 
 As a user I can select saved routes from a menu so I don't have to enter the same information each time.
 
 As a user I would like to see the best time marked for each route to see how/if I'm improving.
 
 As a user I would like the ability to remove data I'm tracking so that it is no longer displayed on my site.
